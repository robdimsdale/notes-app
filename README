Notes on various papers in markdown format.


## Prerequisites

* install bundler `gem install bundler`
* run `bundle install`

## Usage

* To live refresh the site when developing, `middleman`
  * This will just sit in Terminal and watch for changes to be made
  * To exit, `ctrl + c`
  * This is good when making live changes
  * Visit http://localhost:4567
    * This page is only visible when middleman is running
* To generate the site, `middleman build`
  * TODO: this should be done by CI
